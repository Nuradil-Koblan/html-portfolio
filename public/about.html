<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in the city of Aktau on February 22 in 2006. My mother is accountant and my father works as an oilman. Our 
  family consists of five people, actually six because of new born baby whose name is Aisultan. The city I live in is located 
  in west Kazakhstan, Mangystau Region. It has access to the sea which pretty cool. I like my city and my family.

<p>I started my primary education in the Mukhtar Auesov school which is also known as number 20th school in Aktau. I still 
  remeber my teacher named Meiramgul or somtheing like that. She was extremely rigid and strict when it came to disciplining. 
  I was a trouble maker at that school, and I was not a good student either. After tht I moved to 13th school where I spent 2 years.
  I don't want to talk about the things that I experienced there. After applying to the best school in the city - NIS, I got full 
  scholarship and place in dorm. But unfortunately I had to switch schools again because of my grades in 10th grade. I made a lot of 
  new friends at the school and had tons of positive memories in NIS(except in 9th grade)and dropping out of there was my fault 
  actually. But I don't complain since I found new school - 25th school which was brand new teaching institution in Shygys-2. I aced 
  my Senior year in Kazakhstan, at that time I was in the U.S. so I was studing online.

  and memories that I received during my exchange year are undescribable, if I had the opportunity ro repeat this experience I 
  deinitely would do. Yellow busses, American school, L.D.S church, My host family, Rural area, First kiss.....
